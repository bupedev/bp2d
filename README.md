![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/gactk)

Not be confused with the Japanese musician [GACKT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gackt), `gactk` is a UMD Typescript library that aims to provide several feature rich utilities for creating generative art.

The project is still in it's infancy, and currently is limited to some simple geometric modeling (vectors, edges polygons, etc.) and some simple variable modelling. Please see [here](https://bupedev.github.io/gactk/) for the full API documentation.
